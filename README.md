This is an online job search platform for the odd/part-time job sector in Bangladesh built using React.js. There is email and password authentication set up for sign in/sign up actions of the users using Firebase. I used React Hooks and Redux for dealing with state and lifecycle methods during log in/out and posting operations. It has integrated Cloud Firestore to collect and store the job postings made by the people or employers on the forum. Additionally, there is emailing method set up so that the job seekers and employers can connect with each other for further procedures. Finally, the app is deployed on Firebase to make it a running website for the targeted odd job sector in Bangladesh.
